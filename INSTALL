Ivy needs:

python 3.8
IPython 7.13
ply (python lex yacc)
Z3 python interface (import z3 should work)
pygraphviz 1.3.1 (which requires graphviz)

symbolic link (linux) or directory junction (windows) from ~/.ipython/nbextensions/ivy to ivy2/ivy

On windows, the best way to get IPython and ply is to install Anaconda: http://continuum.io/downloads
